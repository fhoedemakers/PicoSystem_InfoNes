## Where to buy the PicoSystem

- UK: [https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picosystem?variant=32369546985555](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picosystem?variant=32369546985555)
- EU: [https://www.kiwi-electronics.com/en/picosystem-10913?search=picosystem](https://www.kiwi-electronics.com/en/picosystem-10913?search=picosystem)
- US: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5289](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5289)

## Sound
### Sound through internal speaker
Sound through the internal piezo speaker is working but limited due to the limitations of this speaker. 

### Speaker mod for better sound
The sound quality will be much better (but not perfect and still somewhat limited) by modding the PicoSystem with a 8 Ohm 1W magnetic speaker. 
Those can be found [here for US](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082658QXL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [here for Europe](https://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/B0BTYDS6FY/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


> This requires opening up the PicoSystem and some soldering. It is a simple mod, but I don't take responsibility when the PicoSystem gets damaged.

The speaker must be soldered with the red wire to RX and the black wire to ground (pad with the  **-** sign) as shown below:

> You can toggle between speakers in-game by the Y + Down button combo.

## Software installation

### flashing the emulator and uploading games to the PicoSystem using a Windows App
Since there is no SD card slot available, a companion app for Microsoft Windows is created that lets the user choose games and flash them to the Pico.
[More information here](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/PicoSystemInfoNesLoader). 

[The Windows application is also included in the latest release of this repository](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/PicoSystem_InfoNes/releases). 

The application also allows you to flash the emulator when not installed or a newer version is available. No more need for manually flashing.

### Manual installation
If you don't want or can't to use the Windows Application

#### Manually flashing the emulator on PicoSystem

- Download **PicoSystem_InfoNes.uf2** from the [releases page](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/PicoSystem_InfoNes/releases/latest).
- Connect PicoSystem using an USB-C cable to your computer. Make sure the PicoSystem is switched off.
- Push and hold the X button then the power-on button. Release the buttons and the drive RPI-RP2 appears on your computer.
- Drag and drop the UF2 file on to the RPI-RP2 drive. The PicoSystem will reboot and will now run the emulator.

#### Manually uploading a single game

> Game must have the .nes extension

Load single game rom by setting the device in BOOTSEL mode. (Connect to computer then Hold X and power on device)
The ROM should be placed at address **0x10110000**, and can be  transferred using [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool).

```
picotool load rom.nes -t bin -o 0x10110000
```

**Attention: the upload address has been changed from 0x10080000 to 0x10110000.** This is because of the additional size of the built-in game baked into the executable.

#### Manually uploading multiple games

> All games must have the .nes extension and must be in the same directory

This can be done by creating a tar archive and upload this archive to the PicoSystem. The maxium size of the archive is be about 15MB

```bash
# current directory must contain the .nes roms
tar cvf games.tar *.nes
picotool load games.tar -t bin -o 0x10110000
```

## Credits
InfoNes is programmed by [Jay Kumogata](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) and ported for DVI output to the Raspberry PI Pico by [Shuichi Takano](https://github.com/shuichitakano/pico-infones). I used the port of Shuichi Takano as a starting point for this project.

Sound programmming by [newschooldev](https://github.com/newschooldev) and [Layer812](https://github.com/Layer812)

## Things to do

- Code has to be cleaned up. Uses parts of the [PicoSystem library](https://github.com/pimoroni/picosystem).

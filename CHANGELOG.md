# CHANGELOG.md

## General Information

> To go back to the games list menu when in a game, you have to press (Y+X) and then (A). This is because of a newly added in-game menu. 

Comes with Homebrew game Blade Buster. When no rom is loaded, this game starts.

Support for flashing multiple games. In this case a menu is displayed in the emulator.

A [Micosoft Windows companion application](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/PicoSystemInfoNesLoader) is added to this release, so the user can easyly flash roms and flash a new version of the emulator.  

Extract the zip-file **PicoSystemInfoNesLoader.zip** to a folder of choice, then start **PicoSystemInfoNesLoader.exe** in subfolder PicoSystemInfoNesLoader.
